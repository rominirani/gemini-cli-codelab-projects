Date: July 28, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (Project Manager), David (Lead Developer), Maria (Marketing Lead), Ben (UX/UI Designer)
Recording Start: 10:00 AM

[10:01:15] Sarah: Okay team, thanks for joining. The main goal today is to finalize the launch date for Project Phoenix and lock in our marketing and development runway. David, let's start with you. How's the final development sprint looking?

[10:02:30] David: Hey everyone. We're mostly on track. The new authentication module is stable, but my team found a few minor UI bugs in the reporting dashboard during last week's regression testing. They're not blockers, but they do affect the user experience. I'd feel much more comfortable with one extra week for QA to polish everything.

[10:04:05] Sarah: An extra week. Okay. Maria, how does that impact the marketing timeline? We were targeting a launch for the week of August 18th.

[10:05:22] Maria: Pushing it back a week to Monday, August 25th, isn't a dealbreaker, but it's tight. I've already scheduled our press briefings for that original week. I can move them, but I need to do it this week. The bigger question I have is the official marketing slogan. We need to finalize it for the campaign assets. Have we decided between "Effortless Analytics" and "Data, Simplified"?

[10:08:11] Ben: From a UX perspective, "Effortless Analytics" aligns much better with the streamlined interface I've designed. It speaks directly to the user benefit and feels more active. "Data, Simplified" is a bit generic, in my opinion.

[10:09:45] Sarah: I agree with Ben. "Effortless Analytics" is stronger. Let's make that the final decision. That's settled then. Maria, please lock that in for all campaign materials.

[10:10:30] Maria: Fantastic. I'll task my team to update all marketing assets with the "Effortless Analytics" slogan. I'll make sure it's done by this Friday, August 1st.

[10:12:18] Sarah: Great. So, given David's need for more QA time, let's officially set the launch date for Monday, August 25th. That's our hard deadline now. David, that gives you the extra week you need.

[10:13:50] David: Perfect, thank you. That's a much safer and more responsible timeline. I will ensure my team creates the final release candidate build and hands it over to the QA team by Friday, August 15th. I'll put that on my calendar.

[10:15:02] Sarah: Now, about launch-day support. We need a one-page, user-friendly guide for the new dashboard features. Ben, since you designed the UI, you're the best person to draft the content for that.

[10:16:15] Ben: Absolutely. I can create a simple, visual guide that walks users through the key changes. When do you need it by?

[10:17:30] Sarah: To give Maria's team enough time to format it for the website and our launch-day email, could you have a draft ready by the end of next Friday, August 8th?

[10:18:00] Ben: No problem. I'll get a draft over to you and Maria by then.

[10:20:45] Maria: One last thing from me. For the official press release, I need the final list of key features and bug fixes that will be included in the launch version.

[10:21:30] David: I can pull that from our Jira release notes. I'll clean it up, remove the technical jargon, and send it your way.

[10:22:10] Sarah: Excellent. David, can you get that final feature list to Maria by Monday, August 11th? That will give her time to weave it into the PR narrative.

[10:22:50] David: Will do.

[10:25:00] Sarah: Okay, this has been very productive. It sounds like we have a solid plan. I'll send a summary of the decisions and action items after this call. Great work, everyone.
